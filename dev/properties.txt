	idk
	
pinCorner
	Valve Dev Wiki says:
		The pinned corner is the one positioned at xpos/ypos.
		Values are: TOPLEFT (default), TOPRIGHT, BOTTOMLEFT, BOTTOMRIGHT
	I can't get it work, numbers nor keywords

use_proportional_insets
	?

mouseInputEnabled
	0 (default), 1
	if element reacts mouse input
	0 will allow mouse events to pass to panels below

keyboardInputEnabled
	same as mouse I'd guess?

PaintBackgroundType
	0 - normal corners
	1 - top left cloudy
	2 - round corners
	3 - left round, alpha gradient l to r

roundedCorners
	add together:
		1 top left
		2 top right
		4 bottom left
		8 bottom right
	works only with specific panels ???

backgroundenabled

	selectedBgColor_override

actionSignalLevel
